The objective is to develop an Employee Management System in Python that utilizes a MySQL Database to store data. The writing will include these actions:

Add Employee
Remove Employee
Promote Employee
Display Employees

The concept involves making various modifications to our Employee Record through different functions such as Add_Employee to add a new row and a Remove Employee Function to delete a specific employee's record from the Employee table. This System operates by extracting data from the database, making necessary modifications, and implementing these changes in the record, as demonstrated in our Promote Employee System. Information about all employees can also be obtained through the use of the Display Employee function. Connecting our program to the database ensures that the information remains intact even after closing the program multiple times, which is a major benefit.
